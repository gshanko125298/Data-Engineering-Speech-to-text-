# Data-Engineering-Speech-to-text-
To recognizing the value of large data sets for speech-t0-text data sets, and seeing the opportunity that there are many text corpuses for Amharic and Swahili languages, and understanding that complex data engineering skills is valuable to your profile for employers, this weekâ€™s task is simple: design and build a robust, large scale, fault tolerant, highly available Kafka cluster that can be used to post a sentence and receive an audio file.  By the end of this project, you should produce a tool that can be deployed to process posting and receiving text and audio files from and into a data lake, apply transformation in a distributed manner, and load it into a warehouse in a suitable format to train a speech-t0-text model.

Tutorials

A great way to start with NeMo is by checking one of our tutorials.
Getting help with NeMo

FAQ can be found on NeMo's Discussions board. You are welcome to ask questions or start discussions there.
Installation
Conda

We recommend installing NeMo in a fresh Conda environment.

conda create --name nemo python==3.8
conda activate nemo

# Install PyTorch using their configurator.

conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch

Note

The command used to install PyTorch may depend on your system.
Pip

Use this installation mode if you want the latest released version.

apt-get update && apt-get install -y libsndfile1 ffmpeg
pip install Cython
pip install nemo_toolkit['all']

Note

Depending on the shell used, you may need to use "nemo_toolkit[all]" instead in the above command.
Pip from source

Use this installation mode if you want the a version from particular GitHub branch (e.g main).

apt-get update && apt-get install -y libsndfile1 ffmpeg
pip install Cython
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo.git@{BRANCH}#egg=nemo_toolkit[all]

From source

Use this installation mode if you are contributing to NeMo.

apt-get update && apt-get install -y libsndfile1 ffmpeg
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo
cd NeMo
./reinstall.sh

Note

If you only want the toolkit without additional conda-based dependencies, you may replace reinstall.sh with pip install -e . when your PWD is the root of the NeMo repository.
RNNT

Note that RNNT requires numba to be installed from conda.

conda remove numba
pip uninstall numba
conda install -c conda-forge numba

Megatron GPT

Megatron GPT training requires NVIDIA Apex to be installed.

git clone https://github.com/ericharper/apex.git
cd apex
git checkout nm_v1.11.0
pip install -v --disable-pip-version-check --no-cache-dir --global-option="--cpp_ext" --global-option="--cuda_ext" --global-option="--fast_layer_norm" --global-option="--distributed_adam" --global-option="--deprecated_fused_adam" ./

# NeMo Text Processing

NeMo Text Processing, specifically (Inverse) Text Normalization, requires Pynini to be installed.

bash NeMo/nemo_text_processing/install_pynini.sh

# Docker containers:

To build a nemo container with Dockerfile from a branch, please run

# DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -f Dockerfile -t nemo:latest .

If you chose to work with main branch, we recommend using NVIDIA's PyTorch container version 22.08-py3 and then installing from GitHub.

- docker run --gpus all -it --rm -v <nemo_github_folder>:/NeMo --shm-size=8g \
- p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit \
- stack=67108864 --device=/dev/snd nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:22.08-py3
