# Data-Engineering-Speech-to-text-
To recognizing the value of large data sets for speech-t0-text data sets, and seeing the opportunity that there are many text corpuses for Amharic and Swahili languages, and understanding that complex data engineering skills is valuable to your profile for employers, this weekâ€™s task is simple: design and build a robust, large scale, fault tolerant, highly available Kafka cluster that can be used to post a sentence and receive an audio file.  By the end of this project, you should produce a tool that can be deployed to process posting and receiving text and audio files from and into a data lake, apply transformation in a distributed manner, and load it into a warehouse in a suitable format to train a speech-t0-text model.
